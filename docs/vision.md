# Project Vision

## Problem Statement

Organizations that manage operational incidents (IT, customer support, internal processes)
receive a large volume of unstructured incident reports written in free text.

These incidents are often:

- Poorly categorized
- Manually prioritized
- Duplicated across different sources
- Slow to analyze and route

This leads to delayed responses, inefficient use of resources, and poor visibility into recurring problems.

## Vision

The goal of this project is to build an intelligent incident analysis platform that assists
teams in understanding, prioritizing, and managing incidents automatically.

The system will analyze incident descriptions using advanced text processing techniques
to:

- Classify incidents by type
- Estimate urgency and impact
- Detect similar or duplicated incidents
- Suggest initial resolution actions

The platform is designed to be extensible, scalable, and technology-agnostic,
allowing future integrations with real-world systems.

## Target Users

- Operations teams
- IT support teams
- Incident management systems
- Backend services that require intelligent incident analysis

## Core Value Proposition

The system reduces manual effort in incident triage by providing consistent,
data-driven analysis that improves response times and decision-making quality.

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful if:

- Incidents can be analyzed automatically from raw text
- The system provides consistent categorization and prioritization
- Similar incidents are reliably detected
- The architecture supports future expansion without major refactoring
